# CS-230-Project-Software-Design

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client wanted us to create a web-based game inspired by an android game called "Draw It or Lose It", which needed to be implented on multiple devices. They want the coding from the android game to be transferred to its web-based counterpart so that way it can retain the original's vision. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did well in developing the reqirements needed for each platform used for the game. Each of the platforms were detailed on its benefits, characteristics, and weaknesses on how it will go when developing the game. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having everything on the table labeled for each of the platform's reqirements really helped make coding easier to operate. With a design document it helps develop certain code that serves a purpose in either creating base code that operates the names of certain game elements (players, game name, team, etc.), or creating code that solidify the elements teams have when created inside of a game. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the design constraints given due to the development requirements needing more details on what is needed for the game to achieve great quality. I would implement more details on why certain decisions on the game is made due to the client having a specific vision of the game, and how that vision needs a program that can transfer it without any drastic changes made.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpret the user's needs by understanding what is needed in order for a multiplayer game like "Draw It or Lose It" to function. Each element is implemented based on what the previous game offered during its release, and these features must be implemented in a web based format, meaning it must be better accessable then its counterpart. The original game on android must be kept the same when transitioned on web, and this need must be made by not implementing any game mechanics that can alter the default immersive experience made by the previous devs.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software based on what the software will aquire during its development process, and what kind of operating platform can give the most options for transfering specific code onto another software. During development, choosing the program for the product to be made in can be the life blood of the game's development success. Windows for example gives a lot of great options to use during the development of an android game (like android studio as a feature), and it gives great cloud services like IBM to negate the need to constantly moderate the online server specturm in development.
